<section id="design">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There are 4 basic design principles:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contrast</li>
  <li>Repetition</li>
  <li>Alignment</li>
  <li>Proximity</li>
</ol>
<p>The principle of <strong>contrast</strong> states that if something is different make them really different. Make them stand out so it draws attention. Can create contrast with color, fonts, sizes, whitespace etc. </p>
<p>The principle of <strong>repetition</strong> states that you repeat some aspect of the design with the purpose to unify and add visual interest. The repetitive element can be a font, a bullet, a line, colour, design element, spatial relationship etc.  Repetition creates consistency.</p>
<p>The <strong>alignment</strong> principle states that nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. The goal is to unify and organize. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.</p>
<p>The principle of <strong>proximity</strong> states that you group related elements together. Move items close to each other so they are seen as one unit.  It implies a relationship and creates a path for eye to follow.</p>

<!-- SEO Search Engine Optimization -->
<section id="seo">
<h2>SEO</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Validate your site</strong> - makes it easier for search engines to read your pages, search engines read page line by line and if there are errors can prevent spider from reading the content. 	Valid html  tends to lessen the amount of code on the page </li>
  <li>Use <strong>alt attributes</strong> on images so search engine understands what image is about. Create unique relevant description of image being described. Never repeat same alt tags unless its same image. Use keywords in your descriptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Words</strong> are a stepping stone into your site, make sure you use words that are easily associated to the topic. When done right, it will show the researcher your site when they are vague with their search.</li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong> is a big factor when it comes to attracting veiwers. The more content the site is holding, the chance of coming to the top becomes higher. Sites with minimal content are often passed over by the SEO</li>
  <li><strong>links</strong> to your site from other big name sites can boost your visibility alot. The more sites pointing to yours, the better!</li>
  <li><strong>feeling the compitition</strong> and finding ways to make yours better then theirs. In every website, there are always ways to improve and optimize the SEO, weither you want your site to be in more detail, or produce more of an overall look of it. The competitor always has a weak point</li> <!--i took them from week12-->
  <li><strong>Updating your content</strong>. Keeping your content up to date is important when it comes to the SEO. the SEO takes precedence on the new and improved sites for the viewer. Falling behind on your updates, makes you fall down the rankings.</li>
